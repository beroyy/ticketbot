# Setup Polling and Completion Feature

## Overview
Implemented polling functionality for the setup page to detect when users complete the bot setup process and show a completion dialog, while keeping them on the setup page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced useGuildData Hook
- Added `enablePolling` option to the hook
- Implemented React Query's `refetchInterval` to poll every 2 seconds when any guild has `setupRequired: true`
- Polling automatically stops when setup is complete

### 2. Created SetupCompleteDialog Component
- Matches the design from the screenshot
- Shows "You're all set!" message
- Includes "Go to Dashboard" button
- Clean, centered design with ticketsbot.ai branding

### 3. Added Global showSetupComplete State
- Added ephemeral `showSetupComplete` boolean to app store
- Not persisted - only exists during the session
- Controls whether to show the setup completion dialog
- Prevents automatic navigation away from setup page

### 4. Updated SelectServerModal
- Added state tracking to detect when setup transitions from required to complete
- Shows SetupCompleteDialog when transition is detected
- Does NOT auto-select guild (which would trigger navigation)
- Sets global `showSetupComplete` flag when setup completes
- Only selects guild when user clicks "Go to Dashboard"

### 5. Updated AuthProvider
- Checks `showSetupComplete` flag before navigation logic
- If true and on `/setup` page, prevents redirect
- Allows user to stay on setup page to see completion dialog

### 6. Updated Setup Page
- Enabled polling by passing `enablePolling: true` to useGuildData
- Navigation only happens after user acknowledges completion

## User Flow
1. User sees "Setup Required" badge and instructions to run `/setup auto`
2. Footer shows "Checking server setup" with loading animation
3. System polls every 2 seconds for configuration changes
4. When user completes setup in Discord, the completion dialog appears
5. User stays on setup page and sees "You're all set!" celebration
6. User clicks "Go to Dashboard" which selects the guild and triggers navigation

## Technical Details
- Uses React Query's built-in polling mechanism
- Ephemeral state in app store (not persisted)
- Efficient state comparison using useRef to detect transitions
- No manual intervals or cleanup needed
- Polling only active when setup is required
